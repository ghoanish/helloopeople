					<h1 align="center"><u>How to Contact WWE</u></h1>
					<p>World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. (WWE) is a very popular entertainment company that mainly deals in the realm of professional wrestling. The company’s corporate headquarters are based in Stamford, Connecticut and those offices are where you should direct any contact inquiries. There are multiple ways you can contact WWE and the contact information varies depending on whether you’re a wrestling fan, a reporter, or looking for a new career with their company.</p>
					<ol style="background-color:red">
						<li>
Call WWE headquarters at 203-352-8600[1]. Doing this will allow you to leave a voicemail message for a WWE Superstar. Follow the automated prompts until you reach the correct voicemail and leave your message.
The Superstar or Diva of your choice will get your message, but it is highly unlikely that you will actually speak to any of the wrestlers this way.
</li>
<li>
Send an email through the WWE website portal.[2] This portal allows you to type in your name, contact email, the Superstar you want to contact, and then provides a box in which you can write a message to that person. It will then be directed to that Superstar.
</li>
<li>
WWE does not guarantee any responses to these messages.
Mail a letter to your favorite WWE Superstar. You can send a written letter through the mail at this address: Superstar Name C/O WWE, 1241 East Main Street, Stamford, CT 06902. WWE does not guarantee responses to your letters, but they will reach the Superstar.
</li>
<li>

WWE recommends that you don’t send anything of value to be signed by the Superstar.[3]
